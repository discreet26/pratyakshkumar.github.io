        <h2>Pratyaksh Kumar</h2>
        <p>Hi there! I'm an aspiring mechanical engineer who loves finding patterns and connecting dots: be it ideas from different industries, people from different backgrounds and teams, or applications from different organizations. I have strong technical skills, particularly in solidworks, and an academic background in engineering.

            I solve problems in creative ways. At BIT MESRA, where I am completing my 3rd year in the College of Engineering, I have learned the importance of applying classical strategies to modern-day projects.
            
            Concentrations in mechanical and electrical engineering provide a broad knowledge of engineering concepts
            Experience at TEAM ASHWA RACING as a member taught me how to apply mechanical engineering concepts to automated systems in adventure sports and competitive racing.
            Passion for innovation, prototyping, and high-quality manufacturing </p>
